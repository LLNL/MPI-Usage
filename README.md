# MPI Usage

This python script analyzes MPI programs and reports MPI usage among other features, such as, number of lines and languages used (C, C++, Fortran, etc.).

## How to Use

Download mpiusage.py and cloc in a single location.

Execute mpiusage.py using the directory of the program that you want to analyze as input. For example, if you want to analyze LULESH, which is in the path `/path/to/LULESH-2.0`, you would run:

```sh
$ ./mpiusage.py /path/to/LULESH-2.0
```
